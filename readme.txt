Code Struture: MVC

Models: C# classes. These are the entities of our program with related properties. Customer, Product etc.
Views: CSHTML pages. These are the screens the user actually sees when running our program. cshtml uses HTML tags to structure and stylise the page and, using @{}, we can write regular C# code in the page.
Controllers: C# classes. These are linked to the model, view and database. Methods will perform checks and then return a View, passing through a certain model to that view. This is also where we add, remove and alter entries in the database
Database: This is created using DbContext. This class is provided DbSets of our models, which are automatically convert to tables and uses the classes properties as columns.
